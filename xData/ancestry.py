class ancestry :
    """
    This class is designed to be a base class for a class (instance) that is a member in another
    class (instance). The function of this class is to aid in tracking a class's ancestors. That is,
    if an instance is part of a hierarchy, this class provides methods, for example, that list
    the position of the instance within the hierarchy or give its position relative to another member
    in the hierarchy using xlinks.  For example, if rs is a class with moniker 'reactionSuite' containing
    reactionA and reactionB, each with moniker 'reaction', then

        >>>reactionA.getAncestor() -> rs
        >>>reactionB.toXLink() -> "/reactionSuite/reaction[@label='1']"

    This class defines three members:

        moniker     Name of the class.
        ancestor    Instance which self is a child of.
        attribute   Additional qualifier for xlink string.

    For an instance, the xlink is '/the/list/of/ancestors/self' if attribute is None or
    '/the/list/of/ancestors/self[@attribute="value"]' if attribute is not None. For example,
    for a hierarchy consisting of class A with moniker 'nameA' and member mB of class B, class B
    with moniker 'nameB' and member mC of class C and class C with moniker 'nameC', then the xlink
    for an instance of a C class in the hierarchy is '/nameA/nameB/nameC'. If the mC instance
    set attribute to be the member 'greeting' that, for this example as value 'Hi', then the
    xlink for the C class is '/nameA/nameB/nameC[@greeting="Hi"]'.
