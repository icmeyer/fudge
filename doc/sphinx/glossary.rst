    evaluation
        A complete set of parameters (e.g. the cross sections) defined at all energies, even when no experimentally measured data are available. It is the task of the evaluator to assess the most probable value of a parameter at any energy, resolving issues of discrepant measurement, assigning values (by an educated guess or based on model calculations) where no data are available and providing data in computer-readable format.
