Welcome to FUDGE (For Updating Data and GEnerating Evaluations), a nuclear data platform built in python that permits
reading, viewing, modifying, writing and processing of nuclear data. FUDGE is a product of the Computational Nuclear
Physics Group (CNP) at Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL).

This current release of Fudge focuses on introducing the new Generalized Nuclear Data (GND) format, intended to
modernize storage of nuclear data. The package includes tools to translate other formats to and from GND, plus tools
for testing and visualizing GND-formatted data.

New users are encouraged to check out :doc:`tutorial/index`.

If you just want to see what a GND file looks like, visit the ENDF/B-VII.1 library pages, there is a version 
of the library in `GND format <http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/endf/b7.1/gndFiles.html>`_.
