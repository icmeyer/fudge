Reporting Bugs
==============

If you encounter bugs, or if you would like to request new features in GND, please take a moment and create a new
tracker item on the `GND project page <http://ndclx4.bnl.gov/gf/project/gnd/tracker/>`_. This ensures that your
request is immediately available to both developers and to other users. As the name suggests, you can also use
the tracker to keep track of the status of your bug report, including fixes or requests for more information.
